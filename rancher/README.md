# Rancher config

Temporary notes, will figure out a better way to describe this later.

## Installing Rancher

- Run the below command to install the Rancher Docker container while persisting the config at `/var/lib/rancher`. This contains a self-signed certificate generated by Rancher.
    - [Documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/advanced/#persistent-data)
    - Command: ```
        docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \
        -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
        -v /opt/rancher:/var/lib/rancher \
        --privileged \
        rancher/rancher:latest
        ```
